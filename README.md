## How to start

Copy file `_env` to `.env` and replace each key with yours

```javascript
cd client
yarn install
yarn run start
```

## Back-end

For the Back-end I am still working on it.
The idea is to store data in MongoDB and use Fastify as server

## TODO

1. Add API specification
2. Add token
3. Add Authentication for users
4. Secure API
